## End-to-End Rewards Flow

This tests all the wiring between admin settings and customer rewards.

1. **Admin**: Settings → Store tab → set `Points per Dollar = 5`, `Min Points to Redeem = 50`, `Points Value = 2 cents`, `Rewards Enabled = ON` → Save
2. **Customer**: Register or log in
3. **Customer**: Add items totalling $20 → Checkout → Place order
4. **Expected points earned**: 20 × 5 = **100 points**
5. **Customer**: Go to `/points` → balance shows 100
6. **Customer**: Add more items → Checkout → see redeem option → redeem 50 points
7. **Expected discount**: 50 × $0.02 = **$1.00 off**
8. **Admin**: Settings → Store → set `Rewards Enabled = OFF` → Save
9. **Customer**: Try checkout → redeem option is gone / disabled
10. **Admin**: Turn rewards back ON → redeem reappears

## Debugging Tips

| Symptom                                  | Where to look                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blank white page                         | Browser Console (F12) → Errors tab                                                           |
| API call fails with 401                  | Token expired or missing; log out and back in                                                |
| API call fails with 422                  | Request body schema mismatch; check backend terminal                                         |
| API call fails with 500                  | Backend terminal → Python traceback                                                          |
| `307 Temporary Redirect` in backend logs | Harmless — trailing slash redirect                                                           |
| Image upload fails                       | Check `backend/static/uploads/` folder exists and is writable                                |
| AI import fails to parse                 | Check browser console for the raw Anthropic response; may need a proxy or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  |
| Rewards points not earned                | Check `points_per_dollar` key exists in settings table; re-save from admin Settings → Store  |
| Menu order not saving                    | Check `display_order` column exists in `menu_items` table (run `init_db.py` again if needed) |

## Known Limitations (not bugs)

- **No real-time order updates** — admin must refresh the page to see new orders
- **No password reset / forgot password flow**
- **No email verification** on register
- **Static pages** (About, Terms, Privacy) are hardcoded — not read from DB
- **RewardsPage / PointsPage** redeem buttons are not connected to the backend redeem endpoint
- **Theme** (from `/api/theme`) is not yet applied to the frontend — site always shows default Flavor Hub branding
- **Platform admin** frontend pages exist; the backend is complete but some edge cases may not be polished
- **No online payments** — cash on delivery only
